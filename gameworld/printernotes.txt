--Make a giant list of cultural activities, practices, schools of thought, 
  entertainment, etc.--
  * Mash these together with plot points to make things fun and interesting!
    * Think like Hit-Man
    * Local gov't wears theater costumes and puts on a pseudo-play in order
      to work out legislation?
    * Fight in a butcher's shop? Hard to tell animal blood from combatant's
      blood?
    * 'Band of Thieves' name of local band? They actually moonlight as thieves?
      * Later on, a band named 'The Werewolves' comes along. Not actually
        werewolves. Let's get all subversive up in dis bitch.
  * Mash 'em together to make changes to culture, itself.
    * How does cultural element x interact with cultural element y?
      OR  apply new element x to established element y
      * Apply magic to banking/coins
        * Certain coins may become imbued with special properties to make them
          more valuable
        * May actually have to do this, as replicating coins becomes easier
          with magic.
        * BOOM Bust a ring of counterfeit coin makers, using magic or alchemy
          to make new coins
      * Apply money system to magic
        * "Online" banking system. Can now transfer funds that don't actually
          exist in the physical world.
        * Wizards standardize an intangible unit of exchange
      * Apply Theater to Government
      * Apply Magic to Theater
        * Floating performances
        * Super special effects
        * Costumes are hyper-realistic
  MAGIC MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE, BUT WIZARDS AREN'T EXACTLY FALLING OUT OF
  THE SKY

* Stick to subjective voice. We learn things from books, people, etc.
  * pick either:
    PC has only access to books they can put in their inventory
    PC has access to compilation of knowledge that is revealed by
    reading other stuff
