If you're going to try to run any of these files, the only real working ones are 'game.py' and 'blocks.py'. Everything else is just a bunch of random code that is not in any way yet a concerted effort.

* game.py is an example of classes working for drawing maps, instantiating characters, and instantiating objects
* blocks.py is a work-in-progress that ultimately aspires to be pygame and AI practice
