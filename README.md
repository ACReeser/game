SEX DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS' DILDOS
====
If you're going to try to run any of these files, the only real working ones are 'game.py', 'newcreator.py', and 'blocks.py'. Everything else is just a bunch of random code that is not in any way yet a concerted effort.

* game.py is an example of classes working for drawing maps, instantiating characters, and instantiating objects
* newcreator.py is an enormous and overencumbered attempt to create a custom character with user input
* blocks.py is a work-in-progress that ultimately aspires to be pygame and AI practice

Currently, 'newcreator.py' is the file with the most code, all of it dedicated to letting the user customize their character. It's on the chopping block, though, so don't get too attached to it.
