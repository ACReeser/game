SEX DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS' DILDOS

If you're going to try to run any of these files, the only real working ones are 'game.py' and 'newcreator.py'. Everything else is just a bunch of random code that is not in any way yet a concerted effort.

Currently, 'newcreator.py' is the file with the most code, all of it dedicated to letting the user customize their character. It's on the chopping block, though, so don't get too attached to it.
